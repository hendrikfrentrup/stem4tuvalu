1. Build a solar cooker

* Parabolic mirror
  * Determine how large it must be:

Assumption:
* The sun shines with an intensity of 1000 W/sq.m.
* We are only dealing with convective heat loss 
* Forced convection due to wind and open to the environment
* Perfect reflection from the mirror surfaces

We want to heat an object roughly 20cm in diameter. In order to cook, the object must be kept at a constant temperature at 180 deg C. The heat loss to the surroundings must therefore be matched by the solar radiation in order to cook the object.

(Solar irradiation) = (Convective heat loss) 

Lengthy calculation in heat transfer:
-best case scenario is no wind, so width is 2m, 1.2m each side. Pretty wide!
